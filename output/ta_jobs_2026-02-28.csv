CONTRACT TYPE: Regular Consultant (CST\-1\)
DURATION: 11 months
LINE MANAGER/SUPERVISOR: Head of International Fundraising Solutions
ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT
The Private Partnerships Division (PSP) is responsible for mobilizing resources from the private sector. PSP has developed an ambitious five\-year strategy and our ambition is based on need. The World Food Programme (WFP) is the leading humanitarian organization saving lives and changing lives, delivering food assistance in emergencies, and working with communities to improve nutrition and build resilience.
Work as hard as we might, through drought and floods, conflict and peace, disasters natural or man\-made, the needs are immense and growing. 828 million people in the world do not have enough food to eat. To get to a world with *Zero Hunger* faster, WFP has significantly increased resources in recent years from donor governments, and now investing in and growing private sector fundraising to reach more people.
WFP’s private sector strategy (2020 – 2025\) has already dramatically increased income from individuals to help reach more people and get to *Zero Hunger* faster, using new digital engagement tools to reach audiences across the globe in a flexible and cost\-effective way.
WFP has a unique opportunity to define its approach amid this digital change, and leapfrog peers through a fundraising strategy that engages people worldwide from one centralized team.
INDIVIDUAL FUNDRAISING
WFP currently has the fastest growing global individual fundraising programme. Our success has been founded on a digital\-first strategy, working through a centralized global team recruiting supporters primarily through digital channels (Meta, TikTok \& Google) and building an outstanding supporter experience through a multi\-channel loyalty programme that aims to deliver a best\-in\-class donor experience. The programme now recruits donors in English, French, German, Spanish and Arabic, with language capabilities also including Korean, and it delivers the supporter experience through email, SMS, WhatsApp, outbound telephone and social media in over 192 countries.
Individual Giving Fundraising in The Republic of Korea began in 2019 with a low volume test of DRTV, but it was not until 2025 that a full multichannel program was launched with DRTV, and Paid Digital campaigns, led by a local Partnerships Officer within the IG team. Following a successful year with an established regular giving supporter base of over 10,000 donors, the Republic of Korea has been identified as a priority growth market with its own requirements for localised solutions and resource.
PURPOSE OF THE ASSIGNMENT
WFP’s Individual Giving team is seeking a dynamic, results\-driven, and resourceful Republic of Korea Fundraising Coordinator to support the development and expansion of WFP’s fundraising program for this market. The successful candidate will build on the activities to date to help establish the foundations for a sustainable IG program and continue the growth trajectory.

E il capitolo che potresti guidare.**

**Responsabile Finance \& Procurement – STURENT**

C’è un momento, nella vita di un’organizzazione, in cui tutto accelera.  
Le città aumentano, i team crescono, i processi si strutturano, le ambizioni diventano più chiare.  
STURENT è esattamente in quel momento.

Siamo nati per rendere l’housing universitario **più semplice, più trasparente, più umano**.  
Oggi stiamo costruendo un modello che possa scalare in tutta Italia: digitale, data‑driven, affidabile.  
Una trasformazione che richiede visione, metodo e persone che vogliano lasciare un segno.

Ed è qui che entri in gioco tu.

**Il ruolo che fa la differenza**

Il/La **Responsabile Finance \& Procurement** non è un ruolo “di back office”.  
È uno dei motori della nostra crescita.

Sarai tu a dare forma alla solidità economica del gruppo, a costruire un procurement trasparente e scalabile, a portare ordine dove oggi c’è velocità, a trasformare i numeri in decisioni.  
Lavorerai a stretto contatto con la **Direzione Operations**, diventando un partner strategico per tutte le funzioni: dalle città al marketing, dal PM al legal.

In un contesto in cui – come recita il nostro Regolamento Interno – *“FINANCE assicura la lettura economica del business per città e linee di servizio”* e *“il procurement centralizza selezione e qualificazione fornitori con procedure trasparenti”*, il tuo contributo sarà visibile, concreto, determinante.

**Perché è un’opportunità unica**

Perché STURENT sta crescendo.  
E crescere significa costruire.

* **Costruire processi** dove oggi ci sono intuizioni.
* **Costruire automazioni** dove oggi c’è manualità.
* **Costruire un modello economico** che regga l’espansione nazionale.
* **Costruire un team** che possa diventare un punto di riferimento per tutto il gruppo.

Non erediterai un sistema: **lo progetterai**.  
Non seguirai un percorso: **lo traccerai**.

E mentre STURENT si espande, anche tu potrai farlo: professionalmente, economicamente, come leader.

**Chi cerchiamo davvero**

Una persona che sappia leggere i numeri, ma anche le persone.  
Che ami la precisione, ma non tema la velocità.  
Che sappia negoziare, analizzare, strutturare, ma anche immaginare.  
Una persona che voglia essere protagonista, non spettatrice.

**Se ti unisci a noi…**

Troverai un’azienda che sta cambiando pelle.  
Troverai colleghi che credono nella missione.  
Troverai spazio per crescere, proporre, innovare.  
Troverai un ruolo che può diventare molto più grande di ciò che è oggi.

* Run capacity planning across value streams and projects, helping balance the mix across permanent, contractor and partner sourcing.
* Partner with the IT Finance manager on headcount and contractor budgeting, forecasting, and scenario planning (e.g., demand surges, technology shifts, insourcing/outsourcing).
* Support the value streams to establish talent pipelines, academies, and reskilling pathways (e.g., cloud, data, security, DevOps) in partnership with HR/L\&D and vendor programmes.

* Embed A\&CM into delivery lifecycle (e.g., gated portfolio, agile increments), ensuring adoption KPIs are defined and tracked in product backlogs.
* Coordinate go‑live readiness, hyper care, and feedback loops; capture lessons learned and feed into continuous improvement.

**Knowledge Management (KM)**

* Define the KM strategy for IT (Service, Project/Agile, Product, Cyber, Architecture), including governance, roles, and taxonomies, aligning to the needs of Edgewing and the framework it operates within.
* Support KCS\-aligned practices for service knowledge; drive shift\-left, self\-service, and first‑time‑fix improvement.
* Integrate KM with collaboration and service platforms (e.g., M365, Azure DevOps ITSM/ESM tools) including metadata, search, and lifecycle rules.
* Govern content quality: ownership, review cadence, sunsetting, and knowledge\-as\-a\-product principles.
* Promote a knowledge‑sharing culture (communities of practice, brown\-bags, documentation standards) with reward/recognition mechanisms.
* Track KM health: search success, self‑solve %, deflection, article reuse, and knowledge freshness.

**Leadership \& Governance**

* Lead a multidisciplinary team; recruit, coach and develop managers and specialists across Workforce, change and KM.
* Chair governance across workforce, change, and KM representing these functions in the IT Portfolio Board.
* Drive standardisation, automation and templates; maintain a playbook for workforce planning, change and knowledge practices.
* Manage vendor partnerships for training, content, and contingent workforce; ensure commercial value and SLA performance.
* Ensure compliance with policies (security, data protection, records management, accessibility).

**Skills and Experience**

**Essential**

* Proven leadership in two ormore of the following with exposure to the third: IT workforce/capability planning, change \& adoption, knowledge management.
* Experience operating in product/platform and/or service\-oriented IT operating models (agile at scale desirable).


Practical delivery of enterprise rollouts (e.g., M365, ERP, CRM, data platforms,
